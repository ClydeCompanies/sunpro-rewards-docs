# Sunroc Rewards Documentation

This project provides documentation for the various features of the Sunroc Rewards program, such as the algorithm for determining the number of points earned by a customer.

This documents the legacy system and some aspects of the new Sunpro Rewards system, but the documentation of the new system may be out of date.
